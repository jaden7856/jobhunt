# AGENTS.md

Guidance for any AI coding agent working in this repository — Codex, Claude Code, Grok, Gemini, Cursor, or another. This file is the single source; `CLAUDE.md` only imports it. Nothing here depends on one vendor.

## What this repository is

Two things in one folder:

- **An agent skill** (`jobhunt`, the open `SKILL.md` format): `SKILL.md` is a router: a mode argument or the request picks a mode file in `modes/` (onboard · scan · evaluate · tailor · cover · deep · interview · track · outcome). Agents that load skills get it through `scripts/setup.sh`, which symlinks this repo into their skill folders; agents that don't simply run in this folder and follow this file. Either way edits here are live immediately.
- **LLM-free Python scripts** under `scripts/` that do everything not needing judgment: collecting Korean job postings, closing checks, the application tracker, scoring arithmetic, company discovery, and resume PDF builds.

If the user asks to find/evaluate postings, write a resume or cover letter, prepare for an interview, or log an application, that is *using* the skill: follow `SKILL.md` (read `modes/_shared.md` first). If they ask to change the tool itself, you are editing the scripts/modes below.

## Running under different agents

The workflow is plain files plus Python, so every agent follows the same steps. What differs is only how the agent is started and which optional helpers the host offers.

| Agent | How it picks this up |
|---|---|
| Codex | reads this `AGENTS.md` when started in the repo; `setup.sh` also links the skill into `~/.codex/skills` |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` imports this file; `setup.sh` links the skill into `~/.claude/skills` |
| Grok, Gemini, Cursor, others | start the agent in this folder and point it at `AGENTS.md` (most read it on their own); if the host loads `SKILL.md` skills, set `SKILLS_DIR` for `setup.sh` |

In-repo pointers `.agents/skills/`, `.grok/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/` hold a thin `SKILL.md` that sends the agent to the root `SKILL.md`, so those agents find the skill without `setup.sh`. Keep their frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `argument-hint`) identical to the root `SKILL.md` when it changes.

Host features are optional add-ons, never requirements:
- **Publishing HTML** (e.g. Claude Artifacts): the posting report is one HTML file; publish the `--fragment` version where the host can, otherwise open the file or give its path (`SKILL.md` "Showing the posting report").
- **Web fetching / search** (Firecrawl MCP, a browser tool): used only for channels the scripts can't reach (`references/judgment.md` §2). Without them, report those channels as unscanned.
- **Question / choice UI:** ask in plain text when the host has none.

Write instructions for the agent in neutral terms ("the agent", "the host"); name a vendor only as an example of an optional feature.

## Commands

No test suite, linter, or build step. Verify changes by running the affected script. Python 3.9+, deps in `requirements.txt` (PyYAML, playwright, pdf2image, pdfplumber); `bash scripts/setup.sh --no-skill` installs them plus Chromium, Korean fonts (Pretendard, Noto CJK KR), and poppler. `install.sh` at the repo root is the one-line installer users run with `curl … | bash`: it clones (or fast-forwards) the repo into `JOBHUNT_DIR` (default `~/jobhunt`) and then runs `setup.sh`; releases are git tags (`v1.0.0`). Supported hosts: macOS (Homebrew), Debian/Ubuntu (apt), and Windows through WSL2 Ubuntu — on Windows the repo, the scripts, and the agent all run inside WSL (clone under `~`, not `/mnt/c`).

Most scripts read and write real files under `data/`; use `--dry-run` where offered when experimenting.

## Architecture

**`scripts/jobkit.py` is the shared core** used by scan/alive/tracker/score/discover: repo-relative paths (`P` dict, all under `data/`), `http_get`/`get_json` (browser UA, 1s delay between requests, 308 redirect handling), the `Job` dataclass, title/career/location filters, company alias normalization for cross-site dedup, `scan-history.tsv` I/O, the tracker table format, and `STATES` (Korean status values). Scripts import it via `sys.path` insertion as `import jobkit as K`, not as a package.

**Providers (`scripts/providers/*.py`)** each implement the same module-level contract: `collect(cfg) -> List[Job]`, `detail(job) -> str`, `alive(url) -> Optional[bool]` (None = can't tell), `handles(url) -> bool`. On an unexpected response shape they raise `jobkit.ShapeError`, which is reported as "응답 형식 변경" rather than crashing the run. A new provider must be registered in `providers/__init__.py`: `ALL` (for `for_url`, used by alive), and either `BOARDS` (job boards), `BY_ATS` (generic ATS keyed by `ats:` in sources.yaml), or a URL rule in `for_company`. Document its endpoints and a measurement date in `references/sources.md`.

**Company pipeline:** `discover.py` gathers candidate companies (tech blogs, GitHub orgs, Wanted company info, `references/company_seed.yaml`), scores notability, probes career sites and detects the ATS, stores everything in `data/search/companies.yaml` (preserving user-written `status`/`memo`), and `promote` copies qualifying ones into `data/search/sources.yaml` `companies`, which `scan.py` then collects via `providers.for_company`. Exploration may be expensive once per company, collection never is: `probe` falls back to common career URLs and then a headless browser (Playwright, imported lazily, discovery only) to find the list API, and whatever replays with a plain request is written as `ats:`, `links:` or `jsonapi:` (`providers/jsonapi.py`, a config-driven JSON collector) so the weekly scan stays stdlib + PyYAML.

**Judgment vs arithmetic split:** the agent classifies each posting line into a judgment yaml (`data/search/judgments/`); `score.py` computes the score deterministically from it: common rules (bands by required/preferred coverage, caps) are constants in the script; personal preferences come from `data/profile/targets.yaml` `scoring` (falls back to `targets.example.yaml`). Rules: `references/scoring.md`. Keep scoring logic in the script, not in mode prose. The agent's own review on top (recorded as `review` in the judgment file) and searching beyond the scripts follow `references/judgment.md`.

**Resume build:** `render.py` turns a resume yaml (schema: `references/yaml_schema.md`) plus personal info from `data/profile/profile.yaml` into HTML, prints A4 PDF with Playwright Chromium, renders PNGs, then runs `check.py`. `check.py` banned words, translationese, and symbol limits come from `references/style_rules.yaml`, so edit that file, not the code.

**Data flow:** `scan.py` → `data/search/pipeline.md` ("## 새로 수집 (선별 전)") + `inbox/*.md` bodies + `scan-history.tsv` → the agent screens → `evaluate` writes `data/job_postings/*.eval.md` → `tracker.py` manages `data/applications/tracker.md` (setting 지원함 moves the pipeline entry to the re-apply cooldown). Markdown/TSV files are the source of truth, and scripts parse their section headings and table headers literally, so changing a heading in a mode file or script means changing the other side too.

## Conventions

- **Public repo, private `data/`.** `.gitignore` ignores `data/*/*` except `README.md`, `.gitkeep`, `*.example.*`. Personal data must never land in `SKILL.md`, `modes/`, `references/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, and new data files go inside a `data/` subfolder, never directly under `data/`. Examples use fictional people/companies (`examples/example.yaml`).
- **Language split:** agent instruction files (`SKILL.md`, `modes/`, `references/*.md`) are English; everything user-facing is Korean: CLI output, script docstrings/comments, `data/` files, resume text, and Korean strings quoted in the instruction files (state values, headings), which must stay verbatim because scripts match them. `README.md` (ko) and `README.en.md` are kept in sync.
- Scripts are stdlib + PyYAML only for collection (`check_links.py` is stdlib-only by design); keep it that way.
- Collection endpoints are unofficial: keep the request delay and treat "missing from the public list" as not closed; closing is decided by per-site detail API/HTTP status.
