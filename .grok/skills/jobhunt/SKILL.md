# jobhunt (pointer)

This file only lets agents that look for skills inside the repository (`.agents/skills/`, `.grok/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`) find the skill. The router and every mode live at the repository root.

1. Find the repository root: from this file's folder, walk upward to the nearest folder that holds both `AGENTS.md` and `modes/`.
2. Read `<root>/SKILL.md` and follow it, passing on the same mode argument or request. Resolve every path against `<root>`, never against the current working directory.
